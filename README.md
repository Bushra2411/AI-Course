# Artificial Intelligence Course Summary


## 📘 Purpose of This Course :
The main purpose of this Artificial Intelligence (AI) course is to provide foundational knowledge and practical skills in solving problems using search strategies, optimization techniques, and game theory algorithms. This course helped us understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how to use different AI techniques to solve various types of problems.

## 📚 What I Learned :
During this course, we learned different Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve problems and make decisions efficiently.

We explored search strategies like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening, Depth-Limited, and Bidirectional Search, which help in navigating through different problem spaces.

We also studied informed search methods that use heuristics to guide the search process, such as Best-First Search, A* Algorithm, and AO* Algorithm, which are more efficient for finding optimal solutions.

In addition, we learned optimization techniques like Hill Climbing and Beam Search, which are useful for improving solutions step by step or within limited choices.

Finally, we explored game-playing algorithms like the Min-Max Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning, which are used in decision-making for two-player games by predicting the opponent’s moves and reducing unnecessary calculations.

These techniques helped us understand how AI can be used to think, search, optimize, and make decisions like a human.
